# Brainrot Blocker Chrome Extension

This extension blocks all brainrot content flying at you. I created this tool to help me focus and prevent me from ending up inside of the scrolling loophole.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Go to your file manager and unzip the downloaded folder
3. Go to the extensions manager of your browser. For chrome this is: chrome://extensions/
4. Add a new extension by folder.
5. Choose the folder you just unzipped and add it as a new extension.

## FAQ

### Will this extension be available in the Web Store?

Yes, I think so. Unfortunately I can give no clear comment on when I will add it to the Chrome Web Store.

Contributions are always welcome!

I think it would be cool to add a popup or something to the extension so people can add or remove links that will be blocked by the extension. I might add such things in the future.
